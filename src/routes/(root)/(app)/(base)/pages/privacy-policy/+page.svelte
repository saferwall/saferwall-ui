				This Saferwall Privacy Notice will illustrate the types of personal data we collect, save,
				process and for which purposes Saferwall GmbH and its affiliates (“Saferwall” or “we”) use
				the personal data for which you are responsible in order to provide you the Service. All
				terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the definitions set forth in the “Terms
				and Condition of Use – Saferwall.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Saferwall is a public-facing community platform which analyses, crowdsources, aggregates,
				and publicly shares submitted data to enhance cybersecurity. Files, URLs, comments, queries,
				YARA rules, and any other content that you submit to our Service (the “Submitted Content”)
				may be retained, used, and distributed at Saferwall’s sole discretion for any purpose,
				including but not limited to contributing to our and our affiliates’ products and services,
				research, product development and/or improvement, enhancing cybersecurity, and integration
				into other product and/or service offerings.
			</p>
			<p>
				You must ensure that the Submitted Content contain no personal data or if so, that you have
				the full and informed consent of the individual, a legitimate interest, or another lawful
				basis to transfer such personal data. You shall be responsible for any conflict arising out

				<li>Use of Twitter and its social media plugin</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Our website uses social media plugins (“plugins”) from the social network twitter.com
				operated by: Twitter, Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, United
				States of America (“Twitter”)
			</p>
			<p>
				The Twitter plugins can be identified by the Twitter logo (a flying bird) on the bottom of
				our website. For more information visit this site https://dev.twitter.com/web/overview
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, we have embedded windows with tweets from our Twitter account (@Saferwall) showing<br
				/>
				the latest of our tweets in a chronological way.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you enter a page on our website that contains a Twitter plugin your browser will
				directly connect to Twitter’s servers where the plugin is loaded from. The information that
				you (including your IP address) have visited our online services will be transmitted to
				Twitter, even if you are not logged into your account. If you are actively using a Twitter
				plugin, Twitter may even process more data and publish content that you are entering into
				the dialogue box. This allows Twitter to map the visit of our pages to your user account. We
				would like to point out that as a provider of the pages we are not aware of the content of
				the transmitted data as well as their use by Twitter.

			<p>
				If you want to prevent the assignment of your visit of our websites to Twitter, you must log
				out of your Twitter account before you visit our site and delete any cookies placed by
				Twitter.

			<p>
				In accordance to the applicable statutory data protection regulations, and subject to
				overriding legitimate interests, individuals have the right to obtain their personal data
				stored by Saferwall and understand the purposes for which we process it. In the secure area
				of our website, you can view your account-related personal data. Please address your request

				You are entitled to request the correction of any incorrect personal data about you which

				data, which may require us to request additional information to verify your identity.
			</p>
			<p>
				You also have the right to request the deletion of personal data held about you. For
				example, if the personal data was saved without your authorisation or knowledge or if the
				personal data is no longer required in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was saved
				or to fulfil the role for which the relevant (public) body is responsible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consistent with applicable data protection law, Saferwall will consider any overriding
				legitimate interests related to your request. Instead of deletion, Saferwall may block your
				personal data, if deletion would contravene mandatory storage periods, deletion is not
				possible or would require disproportionate effort or it is not possible to determine whether
				the personal data is correct or incorrect. Where such personal data is blocked, it will no
				longer be used by us.

			<p>
				You may exercise your right to request the deletion of your personal data processed to
				provide you with a Saferwall account by deleting your account.
